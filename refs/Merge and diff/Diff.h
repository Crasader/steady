Simple Diff for Python version 1.0

Annotate two versions of a list with the values that have been
changed between the versions, similar to unix's `diff` but with
a dead-simple Python interface.

def diff(old, new):
    '''
    Find the differences between two lists. Returns a list of pairs, where the
    first value is in ['+','-','='] and represents an insertion, deletion, or
    no change for that list. The second value of the pair is the list
    of elements.

    Params:
        old     the old list of immutable, comparable values (ie. a list
                of strings)
        new     the new list of immutable, comparable values
   
    Returns:
        A list of pairs, with the first part of the pair being one of three
        strings ('-', '+', '=') and the second part being a list of values from
        the original old and/or new lists. The first part of the pair
        corresponds to whether the list of values is a deletion, insertion, or
        unchanged, respectively.

    Examples:
        >>> diff([1,2,3,4],[1,3,4])
        [('=', [1]), ('-', [2]), ('=', [3, 4])]

        >>> diff([1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,1])
        [('-', [1]), ('=', [2, 3, 4]), ('+', [1])]

        >>> diff('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'.split(),
        ...      'The slow blue cheese drips over the lazy carrot'.split())
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        [('=', ['The']),
         ('-', ['quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps']),
         ('+', ['slow', 'blue', 'cheese', 'drips']),
         ('=', ['over', 'the', 'lazy']),
         ('-', ['dog']),
         ('+', ['carrot'])]
